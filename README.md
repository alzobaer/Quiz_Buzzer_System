Introduction:
In quiz shows, especially entertainment activities (e.g. competitive answering activities), organizers often apply a buzzer system in order to accurately, fairly and visually determine the seat number of a responder.
Now the system can illustrate the accuracy and equity of the judgment by data, which improves the entertainment. At the same time, it is fairer and just. In this lesson, we will use some buttons, buzzers, and LEDs to make a quiz buzzer system.

Components:
1* Arduino Uno board
1 * USB data cable
4 * Button
4 * LED
4 * Resistor (220Î©)
1 * Active Buzzer
Several jumper wires
1 * Breadboard
Experimental Principle
Button 1, 2 and 3 are answer buttons, and button 4 is the reset button. If button 1 is pressed first, the buzzer will beep, the corresponding LED will light up 
and all the other LEDs will go out. If you want to start another round, press button 4 to reset.

Experimental Procedures
Step 1: Build the circuit

Step 2: Program (Please refer to the example code)
Step 3: Compile the code
Step 4: Upload the sketch to the Arduino Uno board
Now, first press button 4 to start. If you press button 1 first, you will see the corresponding LED light up and the buzzer will beep. Then press button 4 again to 
reset before you press other buttons.
